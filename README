This plug-in is to help send requests to and display responses from RESTful
services in Vim. It's useful for working with REST services that use JSON to
exchange information between server and client such as ElasticSearch.

VRC can be used as a cURL client  for simple needs such as getting a
HTTP page response or posting to a form.

Requirements:
  * cURL
  * Vim 7.4 (might work with the older versions)

Features:

* Execute REST request and display the response on a separate display buffer.
* Make changing/adjusting request body easy.
* Can have multiple REST request blocks per VRC buffer.
* Can have multiple VRC buffers where they all share the same output buffer or
  each can have its own output buffer.
* Particularly useful for working with REST services that require the request
  body to be sent in JSON such as ElasticSearch.
* Syntax highlighting.
